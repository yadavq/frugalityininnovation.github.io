			<p>This event was organized on the first day of E-Summit, i.e. 28th April, 2018. The objective of this event was to test the ability of leadership in the students of HBTU, Kanpur. A CEO is a Chief Executive Officer, the highest-ranked person in a company or the institution, ultimately responsible for taking managerial decisions.</p> 

<p>Typically, the responsibilities of a CEO include being a decision maker on strategy and other key policy issues. The communicator role involves speaking to the press and the outsiders, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy. As a leader of the company, the CEO or MD advises the board of directors, motivates employees, and drives change within the organization. </p>

<p>We made a questionnaire for the students which had situations involving the CEO and how the student as a CEO would handle that situation. The situations involved issuing like media handling, policy changes, low profits, etc. We also gave some real life examples of some CEOs like Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg and many more.</p>

<p>We had a huge turnout of participants from our college and from other colleges as well. A total of 55 students took part in this event and made it a huge success.
