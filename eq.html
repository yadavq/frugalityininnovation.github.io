				<p>We came here with a challenge for all students, what do they think about this 16 letter word- entrepreneurship?</p>

				<p>There were just three questions. Students were supposed to get down their memory lane and surprise us with their thoughts and then they would grab a chance to get featured on the official page of GIIEC - Gen-X Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship Cell.</p>
				<p>
				Language wasn't a barrier. Hindi or English: Both worked. We believe in the free thought flow regardless of language.</p>
